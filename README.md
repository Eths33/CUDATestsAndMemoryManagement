# CUDATestsAndMemoryManagement
Developing Simple tests in CUDA to test code behaviors. Also, made a memory allocater to handle freeing all memory allocated with it.

So far only testing basic behaviors such as coalesced and scattered memory patterns, and cudaStreamWaitEvent() behavior that is unclear in NVIDIA documentation.
